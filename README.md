DSP CPE (Configurable Presentation Environment) App

## Running the app
To run the project, make sure you have Elm and elm-go installed globally on your machine.

To install Elm follow this guide: [https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html)

To install elm-go, run `npm i -g elm-go`

`make build-dev`

Then visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the project.

Elm-go provides live-reloading so any changes to `.elm` files you save will be reflected immediately in the browser. Changes made to other files, specifically `html` and `css` files require a manual page refresh to see the changes.
